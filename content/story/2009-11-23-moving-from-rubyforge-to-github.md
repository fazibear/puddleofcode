Finally I moved my [rubyforge](http://rubyforge.org/) repositories to github and gems to [gemcutter.org](http://gemcutter.org/):

 - [gruby](http://github.com/fazibear/gruby)
 - [colorize](http://github.com/fazibear/colorize)

RDoc documentation is now on [rdoc.info](http://rdoc.info/).

 - [gruby](http://rdoc.info/projects/fazibear/gruby)
 - [colorize](http://rdoc.info/projects/fazibear/colorize)

It was quite easy. But there is necessary to use jeweler ? The only thing I need is gemspec file. Build and push are made by gem. There is any thiny tool that can manage version and gemspec files ?
