I'm not so happy owner of Misa Digital first Kitara. Why not hapy? Because it's not working.
Almost all Kitaras and TriBasses stop working because of touch panel failure.
Unfortunately there is no replacement. Those screens are not in production for a long time.

I want my Kitara back. And this is how it's started.

## Software

Software for Kitara suppose to be open source. It's not available now. I found one on my old disk.
Turns out it's use less. Source is for parts of user interface. There is no drivers or things like that.
Looks like I can do much about this. It's useless.

## Hardware
What we got here?

- Main board
- Screen with broken touchscreen
- The case
- Neck with mysterious board
- Few I/O boards

Mainboard is useless, Raspberry PI would be better :)
Screen. Works, but still touchscreen missing. It's easier to get new one with touchpanel.
Case. Goal is to fit in this case.
Neck. I need. This part make this thing a guitar.

Everything is clear. The goal is:

- RPi Zero as a heart
- New touchscreen
- Use neck
- Fit in case

Because new screen shape is a little different I need to make a screen hole bigger, print a bazel and glue it into the main case.
Looks like everything fits. Just need to make all those things work together.

See you in the next part.
