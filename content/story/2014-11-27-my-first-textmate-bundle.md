When I saw, that [Textmate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) supports gutter informations, I want to use it somehow.
While is no good [Rubocop](http://batsov.com/rubocop/) bundle, I want to make my own.
It supports different icons for all severities that rubocop reports.
Check [this](https://github.com/fazibear/Rubocop.tmbundle) out!
